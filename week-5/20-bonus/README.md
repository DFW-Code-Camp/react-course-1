Miscellaneous additional information on React-related tools.

## Create React App CLI
If you'd like to play around with React locally, but don't want to deal with Webpack, Babel, or configure a web server you can use the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) CLI tool. 

The `create-react-app` command creates the React project for you, handling all of those details for you so that you can focus on writing your React components. It also configures a local web server that can be started and stopped via the command line. The server also automatically reloads your page when it detects changes to your source code, which can be really helpful during development.

## React Developer Tools
[React Developer Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) is a browser extension that enhances the inspection anbd debugging capabilities of your browser's existing developer tools to make them more helpful and compatible with React applications.
